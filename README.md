# naco-ispy
Python tools for the NACO-ISPY survey

This repository contains two main functions:

1. The automated reduction pipeline. This consists of two submodules: a data organiser and a database tool.

2. The real-time analysis code. This is an infinite loop that you can run on the offline machine at Paranal, 
  and it will plot important information about the data as it arrives.
